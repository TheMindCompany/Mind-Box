    <h1>Mind Games</h1>    
    <p>This is my little pet project that I started to develop in C++ for a independent studies student at CSUF. I carried it a little further because I wanted to use it at the Blackberry Hackathon in Sand Diego but I arrived to late and piggy-backed someone else program.<br><br>Feel free to email me comments on the class's.  Please remember there only in the development and conceptual stages.

    <h1>AMS: A Student Business</h1>    
    <p>This is a project I am in charge of at CSUF with the Association of Information Technology Professionals (AITP).  I am proud of the innovation in this idea and am dedicated to seeing it come though.

    <h1>Web Mind: An all platform and device web template.</h1>    
    <p>This is something I believe needs to be done.  A web template utilizing the minimal amount of code why staying highly responsive to all navigation, data, visual needs of the site.

    <h1>API Compiler: A concept for better documentation.</h1>    
    <p>This is something I think should be implemented in all IDE's.  A compiler that makes a documented API reference (HTML, PDF, etc.) based on a documenting standard.  I believe this will not only be extremely useful but effective in creating better API documentation.
