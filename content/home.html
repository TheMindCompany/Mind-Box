    <h1>Semester End</h1>    
    <p>Apologize for the delay of the stable 'Web Mind' template to those who have been watching.  Last month of the semester I had to prioritize my education over all else.  I will do my best to implement the last main features when I return from San Francisco and start the summer session.<br><br>
    
    I was elected Vice President of AITP. Current AITP VP, Brandon Knapp notified me shortly before out elections he would be stepping down and asked if I would put my name in his place; no one else made a motion to be VP leaving me the position.<br><br>
    
    I have also opened up my API concept to the open source community in a bit of a different manner then my original concept. Check it out: <a target="new" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mindcontrol/">Here</a>

    <h1>Happy Day!</h1>    
    <p>So if you haven't noticed I finished my transitions for the pages and the sub navigation controls.  This works best on Web Kit engines and will work on Mozilla engines.  The issue with Mozilla engine is the time control.  There seems to be very different frame rates on different browsers.  I have accounted for this by including all the current and expected -browser- controls.<br><br>
    
    I will be looking to fix that issue soon after I implement a deep linking method and internal email control.<br><br>
    
    Besides the design characteristics for me the template will be done.  I have a couple ideas how I can improve it once I finish like shortening and combining a few functions, but that's it!<br><br>  
    
    Soon as I am done with putting together the content and basic layout features for AITP and myself I will be compiling a base template for distribution.  I also want to make a program to compile the code for basic design needs like the sections, titles, sub nav, colors, and name and logo stuff so the end user(Myself included) can more quickly compile a website.

    <h1>A bit of a mess!</h1>    
    <p>An update on the template.  Finally solved my page transition issue, now I have to go back and smooth the animation out and add some variants to how they will display (e.g. top-in, bottom-out left-out, right-in, shakes and bounces).  With this solved I will be able to complete my sub navigation since the two will be operated similarly.<br><br>
    
    I also have been cleaning up the CSS and JavaScript for code and minification.  <br><br>
    
    My code block from my tutorial lessons seems to have a issue.  It works on my template page I wrote but not within my site template, so I apologize for the delay of this part for those who want it but a link to the original tutorial is ' <a target="new" href="http://www.themindspot.com/lesson/ErrorMessageLessonOne.html">Here</a> '.  <br><br>
    
    I also have minimized the amount of HTTP GET's by combining some files and sharing others where possible and adjusting the formatting (i.e. navigation).  This is why the navigation looks a little tweaked.  I am getting rid of the tabbed buttons (With I don't know yet?) and am performing a simpler function call for the sandboxed elements (e.g.  Basically Ajax calls for the nav, links, etc).  This is because the content GET's have a heavier load due to the animations and will make sure the animation properties are placed where they belong without additional processing.<br><br>  
    
    There is one issue with the way I decided to build this template, well two.  Ajax makes it hard to perform deep linking and this will be a major hurdle. Second JavaScript can someone times be disabled and there aspect of my code that needs to account for this possibility and this will be a major hurdle.  BUT! I love the way it works and the minimalist approach I am taking to do this without heavy library usage (Accept Shiv's for HTML5 ie fix).

    <h1>Progress Report</h1>    
    <p>I have made several changes as you can see.  Mainly have done formatting but I have also added some things that cant really be seen yet except for her ' <a href="#" onclick="checkPage('lessonsPage', 'tut0001.html', 'lesson');return false">Content Disabled Message</a>'. Basically I had a fellow classmate ask me how I would do something.  I created a example file and realized I need a few things from it.  One the halt user to answer a message feature and the code display feature.<br><br>
    
    I do not like the header text I created for each article but I may use it for my tutorial lessons section.  <br><br>
    
    Next task are to make the header above where it says 'Welcome to The Mind Company' to open and close every time a new page is selected and to have the page title and or navigation to other inner page locations.<br>
    After that I am going to finish tackling my problem of getting my animation transition of the page scrolling in to scroll out before the new one scrolls in.<br>
    Finish formatting different content size areas.<br><br>
    
    This is just for now.  Make another update soon...

    <h1>Template Near Completion</h1>    
    <p>Template almost done.  This template site started as a quick fix and turned into a project but I am very glad I did it.  Some interesting new things learned that seem to make web scripting much easier for me.  Little fun too.  <br><br>
    First I have incorporated some Ajax into my HTML5 and CSS3 template to load each section into a assigned 'section' element.  I have different assignment id's for formatting purposes.<br><br>
    Secondly I included a contact form in addition to the email address.  I will be adding a server-side email to it soon and a v-card system also.<br><br>
    
    Third I added some nice gradient and shadows that are very friendly on the eye.<br><br>
    
    Fourth, and most fun I added the new 'canvas' element from HTML5 to make a vectored header logo above.  There is not software for editing and creating canvas images as of yet (ie. I do believe Adobe EDGE is making a attempt); I did however find a handy little tool that allows you to do fairly accurate conversions of SVG vector coordinates.  The author is Pierre Lindenbraum and the site where the conversion library can be found is at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/lindenb/wiki/SVGToCanvas">SVGtoCanvas</a><br><br>
    That's it for now.  I will post this project up when the template is complete.
